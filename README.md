# Paragraph Processor Chrome Extension with NLP API Integration

This project is a Chrome extension that processes text from paragraphs on web pages using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It extracts noun phrases from the text and highlights them dynamically using a shadow DOM. The extension provides a user-friendly interface for text analysis and processing, with optional backend API integration for enhanced NLP capabilities.

## Features

- **Paragraph Counter**: Automatically counts words in selected text and displays the count in the extension popup
- **NLP Text Processing**: Uses Natural Language Processing to identify and highlight noun phrases in text
- **NLP API Integration**: Communicates with an NLP API to fetch noun phrases for highlighting
- **Pin to Process**: Allows users to pin specific text for processing with real-time word counting
- **Dynamic Highlighting**: Automatically attaches shadow DOM to paragraphs and highlights extracted noun phrases with red wavy underlines
- **Custom User Settings**: Provides users with a toggle to enable or disable NLP processing
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves user preferences using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync`
- **Clean User Interface**: Simple, intuitive popup with settings and processing controls

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 22.18.0 as specified in `.nvmrc`) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **nvm** (Node Version Manager) - [Installation guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Google Chrome** browser
- **Git** for cloning repositories

You can verify your installations by running:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
nvm --version
```

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rgpl-xyz/paragraph-processor-chrome.git
cd paragraph-processor-chrome
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

If you're using nvm (Node Version Manager), the project includes a `.nvmrc` file that specifies the required Node.js version:

```bash
# Install and use the correct Node.js version
nvm install
nvm use

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

If you're not using nvm, make sure you have Node.js version 22.18.0 or compatible installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies including:
- TypeScript for type checking
- Webpack for bundling
- Chrome types for development
- Copy webpack plugin for asset management

### 3. Environment Configuration (Optional)

The extension supports environment variables for configuration. This is useful for different environments (development, staging, production).

#### Setup Environment Variables:

1. **Copy the example file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file** with your configuration:
   ```bash
   # API Configuration
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
   API_ENDPOINT=/noun_phrases
   API_TIMEOUT=10000
   API_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
   API_RETRY_DELAY=1000

   # Cache Configuration
   CACHE_DURATION=300000
   MAX_CACHE_SIZE=1000

   # Development Configuration
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Environment Variables Reference**:
   - `API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the NLP API (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
   - `API_ENDPOINT`: API endpoint for noun phrase extraction (default: `/noun_phrases`)
   - `API_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in milliseconds (default: `10000`)
   - `API_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`: Number of retry attempts for failed requests (default: `3`)
   - `API_RETRY_DELAY`: Delay between retries in milliseconds (default: `1000`)
   - `CACHE_DURATION`: Cache entry lifetime in milliseconds (default: `300000` = 5 minutes)
   - `MAX_CACHE_SIZE`: Maximum number of cached entries (default: `1000`)
   - `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (default: `development`)

**Note**: The `.env` file is ignored by git to prevent committing sensitive data. Make sure to create your own `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

### 4. Build the Extension

#### For Production Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

#### For Development Build:
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

#### For Development (with watch mode):
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build Output

After building, you'll find the compiled extension in the `./dist` folder with the following structure:

```

## Backend Setup (Optional)

The extension can work with an optional NLP backend API. To set it up:

### 1. Clone the Backend Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rgpl-xyz/nlp-spacy-api.git
cd nlp-spacy-api
```

### 2. Follow Backend Setup Instructions

Refer to the [backend repository's README](https://github.com/rgpl-xyz/nlp-spacy-api) for complete setup instructions. The backend provides:

- **Multiple NLP endpoints**: `/entities`, `/noun_phrases`, `/extract_all`
- **Batch processing**: Efficient processing of multiple documents
- **Performance optimizations**: Caching and memory optimization
- **Health monitoring**: Built-in health check endpoint
- **Docker support**: Easy deployment with Docker
- **Azure Search integration**: Ready for Azure Cognitive Skills

### 3. Test Backend Integration

Once the backend is running:

1. **Test the API directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/noun_phrases" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"values": [{"recordId": "1", "data": {"text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."}}]}'
   ```

2. **Test with the extension**:
   - Open any webpage with text content
   - Click the extension icon in the toolbar
   - Toggle the "Use NLP to highlight nouns" checkbox
   - The extension should now highlight noun phrases on the page

### 4. API Documentation

Once the backend is running, you can view the interactive API documentation at:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8080/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8080/redoc
